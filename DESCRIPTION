Title: Functions to get, clean, visualize, and analize the NOAA's quake data
Description: A package developed for the capstone project of the Coursera's
    specialization "Mastering Software Development in R" offered by the Johns
    Hopkins University.  It consists of a set of functions used to get, clean,
    visualize, and analyze the earthquake data provided from the US National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The package includes two
    ggplot2's geoms to examine the timeline in which the quakes occurred, and
    provides with two functions to visualize the earthquake's epicenters in an
    interactive way using the R's Leaflet maps.
